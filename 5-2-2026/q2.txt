String Rotation - Scenario Question

Problem: Security Password Rotation System
You're building a security system where passwords are rotated daily for extra protection. 
The system takes the original password and shifts some characters from the beginning to the end each day.
Your manager asks you to:

Verify if today's password is a valid rotation of yesterday's password
Report how many positions it was shifted (for audit logs)

If there's been a security breach (password changed incorrectly), report it.
Write a function to check if the new password is a valid rotation and return the shift amount.

Example 1: Valid Daily Rotation
Input: 
yesterday_password = "abcde"
today_password = "cdeab"

Output: (true, 2)

Explanation: 
The system moved "ab" (2 characters) from start to end.
Valid rotation - shifted by 2 positions!

Example 2: Security Breach Detected!
Input: 
yesterday_password = "abcde"
today_password = "abced"

Output: (false, -1)

Explanation: 
Letters are in wrong order - NOT a rotation!
Return -1 to indicate breach.

Example 3: No Rotation (Same Password)
Input: 
yesterday_password = "aa"
today_password = "aa"

Output: (true, 0)

Explanation: 
Password unchanged (or rotated by full length).
Shifted by 0 positions.


Constraints:

Password length: 1 to 100 characters
Passwords contain only lowercase English letters
Both passwords must be same length to be valid rotations
