Group strings that are rotations of each other

1. For each string, compute a canonical representative so all rotations map to the same key.
2. Use a map from key → list of strings.
3. Strings sharing the same key are rotation-equivalent.

Sample Input:
4
abc
bca
acb
cab
Sample Output:
abc bca cab
acb
