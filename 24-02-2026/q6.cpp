Write a CPP Program to find the Linked List Frequency, given the head of a 
singly linked list containing n nodes.The linked list contains k distinct elements.

create and return a new linked list of length k such that:
• Each node in the new list represents the frequency of one distinct element 
  present in the original linked list.
• The frequencies can be returned in any order.
• The original linked list structure does not need to be preserved.

Example:
Input: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
Frequencies:
1 occurs 3 times
2 occurs 2 times
3 occurs 1 time
Output can be:
3 -> 2 -> 1
Sample input:
6
1 1 2 1 2 3
Sample output:
3 2 1
