/*
You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values 
and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.
Return the number of connected components in nums where two values 
are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.
 

sample Input: 
0 1 2 3 4
0 3 1 4
sample Output:2

Constraints:
•	The number of nodes in the linked list is n.
•	1 <= n <= 104
•	0 <= Node.val < n
•	All the values Node.val are unique.
•	1 <= nums.length <= n
•	0 <= nums[i] < n
•	All the values of nums are unique.
